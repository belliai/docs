## Setup your development environment

Learn how to set up your development environment and make your first API request to the Flight Management API.

### Development setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone the API client repository">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository with sample code to help you get started. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview the documentation locally">
    Previewing helps you make sure your integrations work as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 
    
    1. Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: 
    ```bash
    npm i -g mintlify
    ```
    
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): 
    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Authentication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Get your API key">
    To access the Flight Management API, you need an API key. Visit our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to create an API key for your account. Keep this key secure as it provides access to all API endpoints.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Using your API key">
    Include your API key in all requests to the API as a bearer token in the Authorization header:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://mock-server-hazel-tau.vercel.app/api/flights" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Make your first API request

Let's make a simple request to get a list of flights using the Flight Management API.

### Example request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://mock-server-hazel-tau.vercel.app/api/flights?limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

async function getFlights() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://mock-server-hazel-tau.vercel.app/api/flights', {
      params: { limit: 5 },
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching flights:', error);
  }
}

getFlights();
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://mock-server-hazel-tau.vercel.app/api/flights"
params = {"limit": 5}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

</CodeGroup>

### Example response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "flight": "PK202",
      "date": "2023-05-15",
      "origin": "KHI",
      "departureTime": "10:30",
      "destination": "DXB",
      "arrivalTime": "12:45",
      "weight": 12500,
      "volume": 450,
      "status": "Scheduled",
      "baseRate": 3.25,
      "outputRate": 3.45,
      "aircraftType": "Boeing 777-300ER"
    },
    // Additional flight objects...
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 50,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 5,
    "pages": 10
  }
}
```
