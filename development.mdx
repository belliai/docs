## Running the documentation locally

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `mint.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Working with the Flight Management API

### Local development server

For local development and testing, the Flight Management API can be accessed at:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

This server includes all endpoints defined in the API specification and allows you to test your integrations locally before connecting to the production server.

### Production server

For production use, the Flight Management API is available at:

```
https://mock-server-hazel-tau.vercel.app/
```

### Testing API endpoints

You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or cURL to test API endpoints. Here's an example of a basic request to retrieve flight data:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/flights?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Available endpoints

The Flight Management API provides the following main endpoints:

1. **Flights**: `/api/flights` - Manage flight data and schedules
2. **Airway Bills**: `/api/airway-bills` - Create and retrieve airway bills
3. **Reports**: `/api/reports` - Generate operational reports

## Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the \~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API request fails with 401 Unauthorized">
  
    Make sure you're including a valid API key in the Authorization header. Check that your API key hasn't expired and has the correct permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cannot connect to the API server">
  
    If you're using the local development server, make sure it's running on the correct port (default is 3001). Check for any firewall or network restrictions that might be blocking the connection.
