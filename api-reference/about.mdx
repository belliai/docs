## About the Airport Community System (ACS)

The Airport Community System (ACS) is a digital platform developed by Pakistan Single Window (PSW) to modernize and streamline air cargo operations across Pakistan. Launched during a National Workshop in Karachi, the ACS integrates public and private sector stakeholders—including airlines, freight forwarders, customs authorities, and regulatory bodies—into a unified electronic ecosystem.

By digitizing the collection, conversion, and dissemination of shipment data, ACS eliminates redundant paperwork, reduces processing times, and enhances workflow efficiency. The system supports Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Government (B2G), Government-to-Government (G2G), and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) interactions, facilitating seamless information exchange across the air freight community.

In alignment with the Pakistan Single Window Act 2021, all entities involved in air cargo operations are required to integrate their processes with the PSW platform. To ensure international best practices, PSW has engaged two global experts with support from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
